The total number of reads in the fastq file is 94081886.

You entered ATTAGATC as the beginning of the P2 adaptor.  14417140 reads contained this string and were discarded, leaving 79664746 reads for further analysis.

Of these 79664746 sequences, 52224001 reads were an exact match to one of your barcodes and 27440745 were not.

Of the 27440745 not matching a barcode exactly, 10065491 reads had barcodes that could be confidently assigned to one of your barcodes.

This left 62289492 sequences.

Of these 62289492 reads, 41595813 contained restriction enzymes recognition sites that were 2 or more bases away from your recognition site and were discarded, leaving 20693679 reads for further analysis.

Of these 20693679 sequences, 8428979 were removed because they contained at least one base that had a quality score below the minimum value of 20, leaving 12264700 sequences.

Of these 12264700, 153 additional reads were removed from the dataset because they contained a homopolymer at least 15 bases long.

This left 12264547 sequences for further analysis.
