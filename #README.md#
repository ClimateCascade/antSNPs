1. demultiplex sabre (qsub with sabre.sh) pyRAD is slow
2. snp call with pyRAD?

##Setting up github
- add an rsa from mason to github, so github recognizes mason
- change the .git/config file from https to ssh

###Manuscript Outline
Use Keller et al. 2010 as a model

aphaenogaster SNP processing

Tree building program?
Distance?

- ddrad1 ddrad2
- 50+ samples
- what is next? structure
- more sequencing at unc
- look at radseq master list (done. emailed sara the extra colonies)

- trait reconstruction

- tree building
- STRUCTURE (http://adegenet.r-forge.r-project.org/)
- mantels and other trait~geno+temp+(geo)
- sources of variation (pop, colony, individual)
- katie's c:n ratio
