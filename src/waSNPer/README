###waSNPer = Warm Ants SNP pipeline
###Compiled by MKLau Mar 2015
###Based on previous code by SCahan and AGnuyen

###How to use waSNPer
1. Obtain a copy of the folder and move onto the server you wish to use. 
###
NOTE: some servers require users to conduct computation on
specific nodes. For example, Mason.Indiana.edu computation should
generally occur in assigned scratch directories.
###
2. Make sure all dependencies are installed: stacks and bowtie.
3. Modify the waSNPer.sh script to your specifications:
#a directory will be created with this name containing output
outdir=waSNPs 
#path to unzipped fastq files
rads=
#path to a barcode file formatted as: barcode<tab>sampleID
#<tab> = the keystroke "tab"
barcodes=
#path to the "reference genome" index
refmap=~/indexes
4. Modify the waSNPs.job: 
- change the wall time as necessary
- add your email to receive notifications
- add the pathway to your waSNPer directory
5. Submit the waSNPs.job to qsub using: qsub waSNPs.job
6. In addition to receiving emails, you can monitor jobs using the
command: qstat -u <your user name>
